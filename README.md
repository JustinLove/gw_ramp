# GW Ramp

Mixes up the number and strength of Galactic War enemy commanders.

Rather than adding minions independently of difficulty scaling, which creates a difficulty cliff, it tries to create sets of commanders that have a equivalent total difficulty. The formula is somewhat arbitrary and feedback is welcome.

Additionally, difficulty is increased by proximity to boss.

While it doesn't technically shadow `gw_start`, it punches out enough that it hardly matters.
